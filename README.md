# Homebrew

Homebrew is being built for home cafés: small coffee setups run from someone's kitchen or garage. The intended product supports pickup pre-orders, café management, review moderation and one SoCLaaS feature per role. The current build provides the core relational schema, workspace and role access controls, protected Customer/owner Auth provisioning, local demonstration data and local Supabase checks; customer, owner, admin and AI screens are still to come. See the [Developer Guide](docs/DeveloperGuide.md#data-model-and-database-schema) for the implemented foundation.

## User roles

Planned product roles:

| Role | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| **Customer** | Browse approved cafés, pre-order with a pickup slot, track and cancel orders, review collected orders |
| **Café owner** | Register a café, manage menu, prices and opening hours, run the order queue, view sales |
| **Admin** | Approve, suspend or un-suspend cafés, moderate reviews |

## Getting started

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) (package manager) and Node.js 24.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

Delivery workflows and human setup are documented in the [Developer Guide](docs/DeveloperGuide.md#deployment-and-environments).
